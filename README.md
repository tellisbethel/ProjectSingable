# Singable #

## About ##
Singable allows a user to find the ideal singing key of a song for the average singer's voice. In it's current state, it requires that the user give the song's highest note, lowest note and key. I conceived Singable during my time as Music Director at Kingswood camp. Some song keys were too high (or low) for the majority, so I attempted to solve the problem.

After a little research, I wrote a detailed algorithm and compiled the necessary supplementary files. My friend Lourens Schep was kind enough to help me put all the pieces together.

Interestingly enough, in it's current prototype stage it garnered positive interest from a large licensing company.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Install npm
* Install Meteor
* Clone the repository
* Run: meteor, this will load up the server on port 3000
